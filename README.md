## Case Studies
Much of our understanding of cognitive neuroscience is from case studies where a particular human is observed to have isolated damage in a specific area of the brain. By understanding the difference in the cognition between typical and damaged brains, we can ethically understand the function of particular brain regions in humans. While this does not hold the same scientific rigor as a systematic study, it would be unethical to damage human brains for experimental purposes.

## Terminology
* `Dorsal`: Top surface of brain
* `Ventral`: Bottom surface of brain
* `Posterior`: Back of brain
* `Anterior`: Front of brain

## Perception
* `Primary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that are connected to sensory organs.
* `Secondary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that take as input the output from the primary sensory areas.
* Primary sensory areas are labeled with 1, secondary areas with 2, tertiary with 3, etc.
### Visual
* `Visual areas`: V1, V2, V3, V4, ...
* `Lateral Occipital (LO) Complex`: Performs object recognition using the shape of the object
* `Ventral Visual System`: 
* `Dorsal Visual System`: Directly connects to areas in frontal lobe that controls movement. Used to guide action using vision. Carries information about the movement of objects.
* `Middle Temporal (MT) Complex`: Analyzes the movement of objects using information from the Dorsal Visual System.
