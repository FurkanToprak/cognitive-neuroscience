# Intended Audience
* People who are curious about the brain.
* Me when I want to review Cognitive Neuroscience

# Case Studies
Much of our understanding of cognitive neuroscience is from case studies where a particular human is observed to have isolated damage in a specific area of the brain. By understanding the difference in the cognition between typical and damaged brains, we can ethically understand the function of particular brain regions in humans. While this does not hold the same scientific rigor as a systematic study, it would be unethical to damage human brains for experimental purposes.

## Terminology
* `Dorsal`: Top surface of brain
* `Ventral`: Bottom surface of brain
* `Posterior`: Back of brain
* `Anterior`: Front of brain

# Perception
* Two principles:
    * `Locality of function`: Processing information is parallelized by different regions of the brain.
    * `Mapping`: Each aspect about the external world can be mapped to a particular stimulus in the brain. Often the size of a brain region corresponds with the impact that it has with cognition.
* `Primary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that are connected to sensory organs.
* `Secondary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that take as input the output from the primary sensory areas.
* Primary sensory areas are labeled with 1, secondary areas with 2, tertiary with 3, etc.
## Visual
* `Visual areas`: V1, V2, V3, V4, ...
* `Lateral Occipital (LO) Complex`: Performs object recognition using the shape of the object
* `Ventral Visual System`: 
* `Dorsal Visual System`: Directly connects to areas in frontal lobe that controls movement. Used to guide action using vision. Carries information about the movement of objects.
* `Middle Temporal (MT) Complex`: Analyzes the movement of objects using information from the Dorsal Visual System.
* `Phosphenes`: Flashes of light originating from visual cortex.

## Somatosensory Area
* S1, S2, etc.
* Involved with touch, temperature, pressure, and pain.

# Methods of Stimulating the Brain
* `Transcranial Magnetic Brain Stimulation (TMS)`: Stimulating neurons using magnetic fields with a metal coil on the scalp.

# Methods of Observing the Brain
* `fMRI`: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the small changes in blood flow that occur with brain activity.
