## Terminology
* `Dorsal`: Top surface of brain
* `Ventral`: Bottom surface of brain
* `Posterior`: Back of brain
* `Anterior`: Front of brain

## Perception
* `Primary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that are connected to sensory organs.
* `Secondary Sensory Areas`: Parts of the brain that take as input the output from the primary sensory areas.
* Primary sensory areas are labeled with 1, secondary areas with 2, tertiary with 3, etc.
### Visual
* `Visual areas`: V1, V2, V3, V4, ...
* `Lateral Occipital (LO) Complex`: Performs object recognition using the shape of the object
* `Ventral Visual System`: 
* `Dorsal Visual System`: Directly connects to areas in frontal lobe that controls movement. Used to guide action using vision. Carries information about the movement of objects.
* `Middle Temporal (MT) Complex`: Analyzes the movement of objects using information from the Dorsal Visual System.
